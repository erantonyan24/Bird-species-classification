📚 Overview
This dataset contains images of 20 bird species (I used 10), designed for training and evaluating image classification models. It is particularly useful for developing and benchmarking deep learning models in computer vision tasks. I have create a Keras CNN model, you can download this model and use it in real time projects , for exsample you can connect it to web cam and classificate it in real time.

📁 Dataset Structure
The dataset is organized into three main directories:

train/: Contains training images, organized by species.

test/: Contains test images, organized by species.

validation/: Contains validation images, organized by species.
